# Problem 2

## Problem 2.1 Create a tidy dataframe

Create a dataframe containing all file names.

``` r
filenames <- list.files(path = "data/")
```

Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
`purrr::map` and save the result as a new variable.

``` r
df <- purrr::map(filenames, ~read_csv(file.path("data/", .))) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  rowid_to_column()
```

Tidy the results to include control arm and subject ID. Create a long
format dataset so that values can be plotted over time in the following
plot.

``` r
df <- df %>%
  mutate(arm  = ifelse(rowid <11, "Control", "Experimental"),
         id = ifelse(rowid<11, rowid, rowid - 10)) %>%
  select(-rowid) %>%
  relocate(arm, id) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("week"),
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "values",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>%
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week),
         id = as.character(id))
```

## Problem 2.2 Plot

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time.

``` r
ggplot(df, aes(x = week, y = values, group = id)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = arm), size = 1, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 16) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_grid(~arm) + 
  labs(title = "Observations by subject and study arm over time") +
  xlab("Week") + 
  ylab("Value")
```

Individuals in the experimental arm were more likely to have increases
in their value over time. Individuals in the control arm stayed roughly
the same.

# Problem 3

In this problem, I will simulate data to explore power in a one-sample
t-test. Before beginning, I set the seed so results are reproducible.

``` r
set.seed(1)
```

## Problem 3.1 Tidy

First set the design elements, `n`, `sd` (σ), and `mean` (μ).

``` r
n = 30
sd = 5
mean = 0
```

Next, generate 5,000 datasets using the model **x ∼ Normal\[μ,σ\]**.
This is stored in `output`.

``` r
output = vector("list", 5000)

for (i in 1:5000) {
  dataset = rnorm(n, mean = mean, sd = sd)
  output[[i]] = dataset
}
```

Then, for each dataset, save μ̂ and the p-value arising from a test of
H:μ=0 using α=0.05. Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value, use
broom::tidy to clean the output of t.test.

``` r
t_test_fxn = function(a) {

  t.test(a, conf.level = 0.95) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(estimate, p_value)

}

t_test_results_0 = 
  map(output, t_test_fxn) %>%
  bind_rows()
```

Repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6} and store. To do this, I will use
simulations.

``` r
sim_function= function(mu) {
  
  data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = mu, sd = 5) #specific bounds
  )
  
  output = data %>%
    t.test() %>%
    broom::tidy() %>%
    select(estimate, p.value)
}

sim_results = expand_grid(
  mean_df = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6),
  iteration = 1:5000) %>%
  mutate(
    estimate = map(mean_df, sim_function)) %>%
  unnest(estimate) 
```

## Problem 3.2 Plot

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power.

``` r
sim_results %>%
  group_by(mean_df) %>%
  summarize(
    reject_h0 = sum(p.value < 0.05),
    reject_prop = reject_h0/5000*100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_df, y = reject_prop)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + 
  labs(title = "Proportion of times the null was rejected",
       x = "True mean value",
       y = "Proportion (%)") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 6, 1)) + 
  theme_bw()
```

## Problem 3.3 Plot

This plot shows the average estimate of μ̂ on the y axis and the true
value of μ on the x axis, for all samples and in red, just the samples
in which the null hypothesis was rejected.

``` r
avg_rejected <- sim_results %>%
  filter(p.value < 0.05) %>%
  group_by(mean_df) %>%
  summarize(avg_estimate = mean(estimate))

sim_results %>%
  group_by(mean_df) %>%
  summarize(avg_estimate = mean(estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_df, y = avg_estimate)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5, alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_line(data = avg_rejected, color = "red", linewidth = 1.5, alpha = 0.8) + 
  labs(title = "Sample vs. population mean",
       x = "Population mean",
       y = "Sample mean",
       caption = "Red line = samples in which null hypothesis was rejected") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 6, 1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 6, 1)) + 
  theme_bw()
```

Across all samples, the sample average of the mean estimates is equal to
the true mean value. However, among samples where the null hypothesis
was rejected, those samples with true means between 0 and 4 do not have
sample averages equal to the truth. These are most different around the
true population mean of 1, at which mean the `rnorm` function may be
more likely to create samples with an average estimate of about 2. This
may be due to the small effect size, since the sample and population
means were more similar at higher values of the mean.
